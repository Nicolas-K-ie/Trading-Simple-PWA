          1 - Leverage You Will Not Use 
        </h3>
      </a>
 			<p class="comp">
 			        This is one of the main reasons for the
dispensation of trading accounts. </p><p class="comp">Many
people wrongly think that they can make
a living from trading with a capital of less
than 100,000 euros.</p><p class="comp"> If this is your
objective, then you will have to use the
leverage offered by some stock market
products: CFDs, futures, SRDs, warrants,
turbos ... Except that in case of difficulty
on a position, a significant event on an
asset on which you are positioned, your
loss will be multiplied tenfold.</p><p class="comp">
If you use a trading account of â‚¬10,000,
and a lot size of 1 lot per position on
FOREX, i.e. invested on 100k, each pip of
variation of the pair will correspond to 10
dollars if you are on the Euro US Dollar,
i.e. approximately 9 euros at the moment.
So a 10 pip change in the opposite
direction of your position will result in a
loss of approximately 90 euros or 0.9% of
your capital. </p><p class="comp">If you consider the Spread
(the difference between the bid and ask price offered by
the market or your broker), in just 10 pips
your loss will be around 1% of your capital.</p><p class="comp">
Whether on FOREX or any other stock
market asset or product, this is a tiny
variation compared to the average
volatility. You cannot, with such a small
variation, put 1% of your capital at risk.
In case of several consecutive losing
trades, the use of leverage will result in
the almost complete loss of your capital
in a few weeks or months at the most.</p><p class="comp">
You must reason in terms of the
percentage variation of a position in
relation to your capital and not in euros.
For example, take a savings account,
which in 2020 will earn an average of
0.75% interest per year. </p><p class="comp">Are you sure that
risking 1% performance in less than 1
minute is viable in the long term?
We recommend using a leverage of 1 to
preserve your capital truly over time so
that you do not risk one day or another
because of a major event (geopolitical
disaster, meteorologist, central bank
intervention, etc... ) to lose all or part of
your capital and give back to the market
all the benef its of the efforts and work
you have done in Trading for months or
years.</p><p class="comp">
One of Trading's basic rules is not to risk
losing more than 1% of your capital per
trade. Therefore, even in the event of a
signif icant event, if your position should
be slipped, if there is a price gap, a selloff,
a bankruptcy ... you will certainly lose
more than 1% , but you will be able to
continue trading.
Patience, regularity over time and risk
management are the guarantee of
success.</p><p class="comp">

how to wait."
