          6 - Your Loss You Will Cut
        </h3>
      </a>
 			<p class="comp">
 			     In Trading, there is a saying that often
comes up: "you have to cut your losses
and let your gains run". Indeed, as rule
number 6 indicates, the miracle method
does not exist because each trading plan
or signal must have a level of invalidation.
The market will not give you 100%
winning signals, and the best traders will
be able to question themselves and
review their trading plan.
By cutting your losses, you will no longer
have a negative psychological effect on
your trading. You should never average
your losses! Never! Because every day you
will have a loss that you watch everyday
increase until the early morning when
you may wake up to cut it all off before
your capital is destroyed. And maybe
you'll never cut until your broker does it
for you because of a margin call.

On the other hand, cutting your loss
allows you to question your method and
make it evolve without abandoning it
(rule number 4). It is also an additional
place in your trading account that you
can allocate to a better opportunity.
Therefore, it is necessary to know how to
stop the bleeding and refocus rather than
hoping that your loss will come back in
prof it one day.
On the other hand, letting your gains run
their course allows you, even if you have
already reduced the position, to take full
advantage of a scenario that you have
identif ied upstream and therefore not
regret having cut the position too soon.
Generally speaking, it is precisely those
winning positions that are allowed to run
that are the most profitable.
